# Support Desk Personal Project

The website for this project can be found [here](https://shinsupportdeskapp.herokuapp.com/) (deployed to Heroku).

## Project Overview/Movitation
- This project is a support help desk project that allows users to submit personal help tickets 
if there is something wrong about their product. The movation behind this project was that during 
my summer job as a coding instructor, I had to submit help desk requests about certain problems
that I was experiencing throughout the summer, and I thought that would be an interesting personal
project to try to recreate because this support desk was very helpful for me during my job during
the summer. 
- During the summer, as the lead instructor, I was in charge of handling medication to students at 
the camp, assisting with taking students to the dining hall areas, as well as troubleshooting any 
issues related with the laptops that we were using throughout the summer. Since these were the main
topics that I usually sent help desk requests during my job, I chose these as the potential subjects
that a user can submit a help desk ticket. 
## Technologies Used
- For this full-stack application, I was able to use numerous different technologies. First, I used the 
MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to make the application. Additionally, I used Redux Toolkit
to assist with deploying the backend, Postman to test CRUD API endpoint calls, and I ended up deploying
the application through Heroku. 
- Through this project, I was able to learn how full-stack applications were built combining the frontend
and the backend, how to use a database (MongoDB Compass) to store user data, inserting user authentication 
into my application, as well as learning good design patterns such as the MVC (Model, View, Controller) 
design architecture pattern.
